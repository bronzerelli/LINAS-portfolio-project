        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Greetings, my name is Linas. For the past fews years, I have been teaching English overseas. Before that, I started a small business. During univeristy I studied Applied Lingusitics. Recently, I've been yearning to get into the field of computational linguistics or natural language processing.  I've lived an interesting life so far, and I hope the skillls I learn over the next few months create more opportunites for adventure.  </p>
        <p>I also like to exercise, study languages, play poker, read and turn thoughts to things. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>This website is a part of my web-development hero journey. Currently, I'm just a noob in an ordinary world. The call to adventure came to me when I discovered natural language process and D3.js. At first, I was reluctant. "Programming is just for geniuses and math people", I said.  Then, I stumbled upon a few resources for learning and thought, "Hey, i think I can do that". Finally, I buckled down and signed up for the "techdegree" course at teamtreehouse.com. That's where I am now.

        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, I'd like to emerge from the next three months as a web development ninja and can write code with one hand.</p>
